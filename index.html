        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Charlie and I am a self-taught programmer currently living in Manchester. 
                Though I have been working various account manager roles since I left university, 
                I have always been attracted to more technical fields, hence choosing a Nuclear Science degree.
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
                After leaving my previous employed in October 2020, and following a discussion with my brother-in-law who is a software product manager, I decided 
                to support myself while concentrating full time on completing the Full-Stack Programmer course on Codecademy.  However, realising that I was particularly 
                enjoying the creative element of CSS and HTML, I was advised that I might be more suited to the Front-End. I therefore completed what I was told 
                were the "necessary" modules of the Full-Stack course for Front-End development.
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
                After beginning to apply for roles in February 2021, I realised that many of the jobs in my area were PHP and SQL focused, so I took another month off to 
                complete the PHP and SQL courses (once again on Codecademy). 
            </p>
        <h2>Skills & Languages</h2>
            <p>
                The primary focus of my studies has been the below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                However I have also worked with the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>Git Bash</li>
                <li>Git Hub</li>
                <li>Markdown</li>
                <li>Mocha</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2> 
            <p>These are some of the main projects I have completed while learning</p>

        <details open>
            <summary>Project 1: Spotify API App.</summary>
                <p>
                    A website which allows users to make a playlist and save it to their Spotify Account using the Spotify API. Made using CSS, HTML and REACT.js.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>(note: At present it appears that there is a fault with the Spotify API which unfortunately hinders the functionality of the App.  I am intermittently 
                    checking the Codecademy forums to see if this has been resolved.)
