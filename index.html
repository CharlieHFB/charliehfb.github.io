        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Charlie and I am a self-taught programmer currently living in Manchester. 
                Though I have been working various account manager roles since I left university, 
                I have always been attracted to more technical fields, hence choosing a Nuclear Science degree.
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
                After a discussion with my brother-in-law who is a software product manager, I decided to leave my previous employer in October 2020 in order to 
                concentrate full time on the Full-Stack Developer course on Codecademy.  However, realising that I was particularly 
                enjoying the creative element of CSS and HTML, I was advised that I might be more suited to the Front-End.
            </p>
        <h2>Skills & Languages</h2>
            <p>
                The Majority of my time has been spent learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  However I have also worked with the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>React (My current focus)</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>Git Bash</li>
                <li>Git Hub</li>
                <li>Markdown</li>
                <li>Mocha</li>
            </ul>
